# GUI-Games

Speed Test : 
      I have attempted to create a GUI based project in python using the tkinter module.
      The project accepts the player's name and also shows the name of the player with the highest score on the title window.
      The high score is constantly updated using a text file.
      After the title window, the player is directed to the game window, where they have to type the given sentence as fast as they can.
      Random module has also beeen used to select the question sentence from a list of previously defined question sentences.
      After the user hits enter, his answer is submitted and his typing speed in Words Per Minute (WPM) is calculated along with the accuracy.
      The final score is a product of the accuracy and the typing speed.
      If the final score beats the high score, the credentials are updated.
      The player is notified about his score by a message box.
     
    
More to come.
